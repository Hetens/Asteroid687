## Setup

### Installation

#### 1. Install SDL libraries

SDL libraries are required for rendering on-screen text and HUD elements in the PyGame window. (if you see some font related issues on the run, this should fix it. Additionally uninstall and install pygame again after running the command below)

```bash
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf
```

#### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
